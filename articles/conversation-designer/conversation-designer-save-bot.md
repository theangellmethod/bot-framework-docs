# Saving your Conversation Designer bot
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Conversation Designer is not available to all customers yet. More details on
> availability of Conversation Designer will come later this year.

While working the in the conversation designer, all your work is cached in browser memory. To commit your changes, click the **Save** button located in the upper left corner of the designer window. To avoid loosing work, it is recommended that you save your work often. Besides clicking the **Save** button, you may also save your work by using the **CTRL+S** keyboard short-cut.

## Trains LUIS and primes speech recognition

Clicking the **Save** button will save changes to the bot. Unlike the keyboard short-cut, clicking the **Save** button also instruct Conversation Designer to perform the following tasks:

- Trains any LUIS intents and entities for the bot and publishes the LUIS model locally in your Azure bot service (if needed).
- Updates the conversation runtime to use the new LUIS model.
- Prepares and sends your example utterances to Microsoft Cognitive Services, which vastly improves speech recognition accuracy for this bot.
